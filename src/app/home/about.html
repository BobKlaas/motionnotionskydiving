        <h2>The Notion of Motion</h2>
        <p>As we move through life, we experience fear, stress, anxiety, hardship, and uncertainty. These feelings move in and out of our experience. They eventually give way to moments of strength, happiness, laughter, and love. Collectively, they bring us together and give us a true sense of our presence in this space.</p>
        <p>We see motion in this same light. When we are able to unplug from the ordinary, we are able to experience real, organic, flight. By letting go, we become free to express ourselves. It’s during these moments that we will discover our true expression and style.</p>
        <p>We believe that every skydive is a choice. A choice to transcend fear. A choice to be present. A choice to let go of the ordinary. However, with every choice, we are also gifted an opportunity. An opportunity to smile. An opportunity to feel connected. An opportunity to learn about who we really are.</p>
        <p>Motion Notion is about sharing our essence with each other. It’s about sharing the space we occupy together; in the sky and on the ground. We welcome you to join us in this space.</p>
        <p>Thank you for sharing your essence with us. We are humbled. Live MoNo.</p>
        <!-- <p>Motion Notion was created by Bob Klaas and Nadav Schwartz in 2016. Based out of Skydive Elsinore, they wanted to start a movement geared towards dynamic freeflying. This movement was fueled by their love for motion and individual expression. As the idea evolved, the brand Motion Notion was born.</p>
        <p>Motion Notion in its direct definition translates to "the idea of motion". However, it embodies something far greater. It embodies a lifestyle that encourages motion, taking chances, flying your own line, living your passion, and sharing that passion with others. What started out as an idea, is now real. We love skydiving, expression, life, and we welcome you to join us on this journey. Let's keep things in motion.</p> -->
